# DataMiner

A data mining algorithm for a class project. The master branch is the original code I wrote for the class project, which implements
the Max-Miner data mining algorithm. The lookahead branch is the code I used to implement and test M-step Lookahead, 
an experimental variant of the Max-Miner algorithm proposed by Dr. Soon Chung. The algorithm and the results of the tests have 
been published under the title, "Efficient Mining of Maximal Frequent Itemsets Based on M-Step Lookahead." This paper was published
in The 5th International Conference on Data and Software Engineering, pp. 65-69.

Both branches depend on version 4.0 of the Apache jmeter library, which can be accessed at 
https://archive.apache.org/dist/jmeter/binaries. This code only requires the jorphan.jar file in this library.
